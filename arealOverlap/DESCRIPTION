Description: The arealOverlap package works to solve how to weight population and sociodemographic data related to 
    polygon shapefile data that is non-nested. The process works by taking in the input from an ArcGIS python toolbox 
    output, or similarly outputted data, which is the three way intersection between two shapefiles of interest, and a 
    census tabulation shapefile. The resulting data informs the user as to how to measure change or shared population
    characteristics between different levels/temporal states of geography, in addition to how complex the process is. 
    The primary script works by weighting the subsetted space between geographic unit A and B relative to their shared 
    overlap between a census tabulation unit. The population of the unit are then weighted by the three-way intersection
    and the area of the census tabulation unit. Data are then marginalized by dyad, areal unit 1 and areal unit 2, in 
    order to inform the user the shared dyadic population, and how fragile the data of interest is to multilevel areal
    unit problems (MAUP). Functions include a dyadic calculator to find the overlap between all first and second shapefiles with at least
    some population overlap, a herfindahl index calculator that reports how split up the first level of georaphy is
    a function to find the best match between the first and second geographies by knowing the maximum population 
    overlap, and finally a function that calculates what proportion of the second level of geography's population
    could be correctly matched by knowing assigning the first level of geography to the second level of geography 
    based on the maximum population overlap.
