The script is designed to solve Modifiable Areal Unit Problems (MAUP) where one must find and determine the level of 
overlap between two different sets of poygons that are not perfectly nested within each other. MAUP becomes a serious issue whenever the user needs to determine how to allocate some unit of interest within some first level of geography (i.e. precincts, ZIP codes, state house districts, etc.) to some higher level of geography (i.e. State Senate districts, U.S. Congressional districts, etc.).
